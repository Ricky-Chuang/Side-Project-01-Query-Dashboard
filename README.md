# Side-Project-01-Query-Dashboard
This is an user-friendly query dashboard.

This is a situation that simulates when colleagues from other departments keep looking for data from the data department. 
Since these tasks take a certain amount of time to process and decrease work efficiency of colleagues in the data team. 
Therefore, I tried to make a Dashboard, so that colleagues in other departments could directly query the required data by just clicking and selecting.
The dataset is from Kaggle's Open Source, and the Database is simulated using SQLite3.
